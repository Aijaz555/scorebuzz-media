# ScoreBuzz live scoreboard streams

YouTube live streams that show a game's live score, not the game itself. This is the same
format as Dope Media (@dopemediaph) and Sports Lounge (@Sportslounge6), which get
5k–250k views per stream. Each stream is a branded 1920x1080 scoreboard with:

- the score, clock/period and status (UPCOMING → LIVE → FINAL), with a flash when the score changes
- score by quarter / period / half / inning
- top performers for both teams (points/rebounds/assists, passing/rushing/receiving yards…)
- play-by-play (NBA, NFL, NHL, NCAAF, MLB) or key events (goals, cards) for football
- NFL/NCAAF: down & distance, possession and red zone
- a ticker with the league's other games, and scorebuzz.net branding

There is no footage, no audio commentary, no logos and no player photos: team badges are the
team abbreviation on the team colour. Leagues: `nba nfl nhl ncaaf mlb epl ucl laliga seriea bundesliga mls`.

## Files

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `feed.js` | Reads ESPN's public scoreboard/summary JSON and normalises it. All data-shape fixes go here. |
| `server.js` | Local web server: scoreboard page at `/?league=nba&event=<id>`, JSON at `/api/game`, `/api/games`. |
| `scoreboard.html` | The 1920x1080 scoreboard (refreshes every 5 s). Also usable as an OBS browser source. |
| `games.js` | Lists today's games with ESPN event ids, ET/UK/PKT times and a YouTube title + description. |
| `stream.js` | Streams one game to YouTube (or records to a file with `--out`). Stops 20 min after the final. |
| `autopilot.js` | For an always-on server: starts a stream for every game, 15 min before it begins. |
| `setup_vps.sh` | Installs everything on a fresh Ubuntu server. |
| `fixtures/` | **Fake** test games for `SCOREBUZZ_MOCK=1` (not real teams or scores). |

## Try it

```bash
npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium   # once; ffmpeg must be installed
node tools/live/games.js nba nfl epl                          # today's games + titles
node tools/live/server.js                                     # then open http://localhost:8787/?league=nba&event=<id>
node tools/live/stream.js --league nba --event <id> --out test.mp4 --minutes 1   # 1-minute test recording
SCOREBUZZ_MOCK=1 node tools/live/server.js                    # offline, with the fake test games (event 9001)
```

## Go live on YouTube

1. **Turn on live streaming** for the channel: YouTube Studio → Go live (needs a verified phone; the first time takes up to 24 hours).
2. **Get a stream key**: Studio → Go live → Stream → copy the stream key. Make extra keys (one per game you want live at the same time) under "Stream settings → Select stream key → Create new stream key".
3. **Set the title and description** from `games.js` for the broadcast on that key.
4. Run: `node tools/live/stream.js --league nba --event <id> --key <stream key>`.

Manual alternative with no server: add `http://localhost:8787/?league=nba&event=<id>` as a 1920x1080 Browser Source in OBS and press Start Streaming.

## Fully automatic (next step)

`autopilot.js` + a stream-key pool already starts and stops the video for every game. What it can't
do yet is create a YouTube broadcast per game with the right title: that needs the YouTube Data API
(`liveBroadcasts.insert` + `liveBroadcasts.bind`) with an OAuth client and refresh token for the
channel, set up once in Google Cloud Console. Until then, schedule the broadcasts in YouTube Studio
with "auto-start" on, one per key.

Hosting: a $5–12/month Ubuntu VPS (2 vCPU / 2–4 GB) runs 3–4 streams at once; each uses about
0.6 CPU core and 3.1 Mbps upload. Run `bash tools/live/setup_vps.sh`, put keys in
`tools/live/live.config.json` (copy `live.config.example.json`), then `pm2 start tools/live/autopilot.js -- tools/live/live.config.json`.

## Rules

- Title format: `<Team> vs <Team> | NBA Live Scoreboard & Play-by-Play` (`games.js` builds it). Always say "Scoreboard" so nobody expects game video; never say "full game", "HD stream" or "watch free".
- No logos, photos, footage or TV audio. Team names and colours only.
- Description says it is a live scoreboard without footage, and links scorebuzz.net.
- YouTube can limit monetization on channels whose videos are mass-produced or repetitive. Each stream has different live data, but keep the channel varied (Shorts, recaps) and don't run streams for games with no audience.
- ESPN's JSON API is unofficial, with no SLA: if it changes or blocks requests, `feed.js` is the only file to change (or swap in a paid feed such as Sportradar/API-Sports).
